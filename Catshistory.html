    <h2>The History of Cat Domestication, and How Our Furry Friends Domesticated Themselves</h2>
    <p>Enigmatic and elegant, cats have captivated humans for millennia. From sacred animals in ancient Egypt to viral sensations on the internet, the domestic cat, Felis catus, has evolved from a wild predator into a beloved pet. Unlike dogs, whose domestication was actively guided by humans, cats chose domestication on their own terms. Below are twenty fascinating facts about the rich tapestry of cat history, from their evolutionary roots to their domestication and cultural impact across civilizations.</p>
    <p>The cuddly tabbys story begins with its wild ancestors. Modern domestic cats descend from a species of wildcat known as Felis lybica, or the African wildcat. Solitary and stealthy hunters, they still roam the savannas and deserts of Africa and the Middle East. Genetic studies show that all domestic cats today trace their ancestry to F. lybica, particularly to a population located in the Near East around 9,000 years ago.
        Cats are part of the Felidae family, which includes lions, tigers, leopards, and cheetahs. They are obligate carnivores with finely tuned hunting skills, a trait that was crucial for their eventual relationship with humans. As seen below, the transition from wildcat to domestic companion was less about human intervention, and more about mutual benefit.</p>
    <h2>The Earliest Known Close Link Between Humans and Cats</h2>
    <img class="media" src="img/link between cats.webp" alt="Skeleton">
    <p>About 10,000 years ago, humans began to form permanent settlements in the Fertile Crescent – the cradle of agriculture. Early farmers stored surplus grain, which attracted rodents. Wildcats, in turn, were drawn to the abundant rodent prey near human settlements. The tamest and least aggressive wildcats lingered around, and gradually became less fearful of humans. Humans recognized the benefits of natural rodent control, so they tolerated and even encouraged the wildcats’ presence.
    That symbiotic relationship started cat domestication. The earliest definitive evidence of a close relationship between humans and cats comes was found in Cyprus, dated circa 7500 BC. A burial site was discovered in which a human and a cat were interred together, suggesting a strong bond. Since Cyprus is an island with no native feline species, the presence of a cat indicates it was intentionally brought by humans – implying domestication, or at least a mutually beneficial partnership.</p>
    <h2>The Pet That Domesticated Itself</h2>
    <p>Cat domestication did not result from deliberate human efforts. Instead, the process was initiated and driven by the cats themselves. Attracted by rodents that were attracted to human agriculture, wildcats deliberately sought out agricultural communities and their yummy rodents. After thousands of years in which wildcats lived alongside humans and preyed upon the rodents that infest our crops, they changed.Eventually, enough genetic variation arose between wildcats that lived in human communities and those still out in the wild, that a new species emerged: the domestic cat. Humans did not deliberately bring that about, but simply tolerated and welcomed the wildcats that ate the rodents that stole our grains. So in that sense, we did not domesticate wildcats. Instead, wildcats domesticated themselves and transformed into beloved pets.</p>
    <h2>Sacred Cats</h2>
    <img class="media" src="img/sacred cats.jpg" alt="statue">
    <p>The domestication of cats in the Near East was a singular event, or one limited to a small geographic area. It thus differed from the more widespread and repeated domestication of dogs in various places at various times around the world. Cats were welcomed in many places, but in ancient Egypt, they were revered. By 2000 BCE, cats were common in Egyptian art, often shown in domestic settings.
    The goddess Bastet, depicted as a lioness or as a woman with a cat’s head, became a prominent deity of home, fertility, and protection. Ancient Egyptian cats were sacred animals – symbols of protection, fertility, and divine power. Paradoxically, though, that reverence gave rise to a practice that probably disturbs modern sensibilities: the ritual sacrifice and mummification of cats. However, far from being acts of cruelty, such sacrifices were deeply rooted in religious devotion and complex spiritual beliefs.</p>
    <h2> Ancient Cats Beyond the Nile Valley</h2>
    <img class="media" src="img/ancientcat.jpg" alt="ancientcat">
    <p>Cats in ancient Mesopotamia were not deified as in Egypt, but were still appreciated for their utility in controlling vermin. Artistic and written references from Babylonian and Assyrian texts highlight their presence and usefulness in both homes and temples. Cats reached India and China by the early centuries AD, likely through trade routes.
    In China, they became associated with good luck and prosperity, and Buddhist monks welcomed cats into temples to protect sacred texts from rodents. By the time of the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), cats had fully integrated into Chinese households. Ancient texts and artwork from this period show domestic cats as both practical and symbolic creatures. Centuries later, Chinese and Japanese art from the Tang and Heian periods depict cats as elegant and mysterious beings, sometimes credited with supernatural awareness.</p>
    <h2>Cats in Chinese Society</h2>
    <p>In traditional Chinese society, cats were primarily valued for their utility. Agriculture formed the backbone of Chinese civilization, and grain storage was crucial to the economy and social stability. Cats served as natural guardians of grain, and protected precious stores from rats and mice. However, their role was not solely functional: they began to take on symbolic and spiritual importance. Cats were seen as bringers of good luck, and protectors of the home.
    Ancient Chinese beliefs held that cats could repel evil spirits and negative energy. Their stealthy nature and nocturnal habits led to an association with vigilance and mystery. The famous “zhaocai mao” or maneki-neko, the “beckoning cat”, though more strongly associated with Japan today, has roots in Chinese folklore and Taoist symbolism. Such statues, often found in businesses and homes, are believed to attract prosperity and good fortune.</p>
    <h2>Cats in Europe: From Companions to Evil Creatures</h2>
    <p>The Romans admired Egyptian culture, and brought cats into their households across the empire. As the Roman Empire expanded, cats spread throughout Europe and into the British Isles. After Rome fell, though, the Middle Ages became a dark period for cats in Europe. As Christianity spread, pagan symbols and deities, including cats, were recast as demonic. Cats, especially black ones, became associated with witchcraft and the devil. That shift had devastating consequences.
    During the Black Death in the fourteenth century, cats were often blamed as harbingers of evil. Ironically, the mass killing of cats may have worsened the plague, as it reduced the natural population control of rats, the plague’s true carriers. By the seventeenth century, cats began to regain favor, especially in France and England. They were appreciated again for their elegance, and usefulness in pest control. Artists, writers, and thinkers began to document and admire feline behavior.</p>
    <h2>Cats in the Modern Era</h2>
    <p>The nineteenth century marked a turning point. In the Victorian era, keeping pets became a middle and upper class pastime. Cat shows and breeding programs began in earnest. The first modern cat show was held at London’s Crystal Palace in 1871. It catalyzed the formalization of cat breeds, and the development of cat fancier societies. The British Shorthair, Persian, and Siamese, were among the first recognized breeds. In Japan, the “maneki-neko,” or beckoning cat, became a symbol of good fortune.
    In Russia, cats were kept in the Hermitage Museum to control rodent populations, and are still employed there today. In the United States, cats gained widespread popularity in the twentieth century. The invention of commercial cat food and litter made keeping cats more convenient, while their independent nature suited modern lifestyles. By the late twentieth century, cats surpassed dogs as the most popular pet in many urban settings.</p>
    <h2>The First Viral Cats</h2>

    <p>Henry Pointer’s innovative approach resonated with the Victorian public, and by 1872, he had produced over 100 such captioned images. The series, collectively titled “The Brighton Cats”, expanded to approximately 200 photographs by 1884. These images were widely distributed as cartes-de-visite – small photographic prints mounted on cards—that served both as collectibles and as a form of social correspondence. The popularity of Pointer’s work extended beyond commercial success, and garnered great critical acclaim.
    He exhibited his photographs at the annual exhibitions of The Photographic Society of Great Britain between 1870 and 1885, and his feline subjects often took center stage. Pointer’s “Brighton Cats” series not only entertained his contemporaries, but also laid the groundwork for the modern phenomenon of humorous cat imagery. He was a pioneer in pet photography, and his ability to capture the endearing and amusing aspects of feline behavior continues to influence visual culture to this day.</p>
